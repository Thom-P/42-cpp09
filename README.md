# 42-cpp09 (C++ STL containers)
This project from School 42 aims to get students acquainted with the C++ STL containers. The detailed subject can be found at the root of the repository. 
The project consists of three exercises that need to be solved using different containers:
- ex00: create a Bitcoin exchange value lookup table (importing a database into a hashmap).
- ex01: create a Reverse Polish Notation calculator (using a stack). This notation allows to unambiguoulsy write arithmetic formulaes without parenthesis. 
- ex02: implement the Ford-Johnson "merge-insertion sort" algorithm (using a vector and a deque). This algorithm aims at sorting elements while minimizing the number of pairwise comparisions.
